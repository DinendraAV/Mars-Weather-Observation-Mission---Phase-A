## Project Overview  

**Mission Objectives**:  
- The **MONARCH** project aims to develop a detailed **atmospheric research mission design** to analyze the Martian climate and weather. Understanding these patterns is critical for enabling **future human-scale landing missions** and long-term Mars exploration.  
- MONARCH specifically aims to ensure that future human landings and extravehicular activities on Mars can be conducted with acceptable risk. This aligns with the first two objectives outlined by the **Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG)** within **NASA's Mars Exploration Program (MEP)'s** goal of preparing for human exploration.

- MONARCH mission aims at covering 3 scientific objectives:

‚Ä¢ Determine the aspects of the atmospheric state that affect **capture and Entry, Descent and Landing** for human scale mission to Mars.

‚Ä¢ Assess **Landing Site characteristics and environment** related to safe landing for human scale landers.

‚Ä¢ Assess the **climatological risk of dust storm activity in the human exploration zone** at least one year in advance of landing¬†operations.

**My Role**:  
I managed the **Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS)** for the Lander and Rover operations. I conducted sinngle nodal and multi-nodal thermal analysis to ensure optimal temperature control for sensitive components such as batteries, electronics etc. during mission operations.

## Methodology  

1. **Mission Design**:  
   - **Literature study** was carried out in an extensive manner to develop the foundation and base ideas for the **Phase A mission design**.
   - **Worked in a multidisciplinary team and Collaborated with the other subsystem team members** and listened to their ideas of the development of the mission.
   - **Participated in group discussions** with our team members and our professor for discussing about the **state-of-the-art technologies** including **launch vehicles** which could be possibly used in our mission and we finalised to have a **dual launch structure fairing configuration** after many discussions, where it would be congigured as **two different but interlinked assemblies** in a **Ariane VI launcher with 2 entry capsules, carrying 1 orbiter, 2 landers and 2 rovers.**
   - **ECSS Standards** were studied and taken into consideration during each and every step of our mission design and **strictly adhered to the latest standards**.

2. **Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS)**:
   - I headed the **Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS) for Ground operations (Lander and Rover)** primarily and I also **closely aided the team head of TCS for Spacecraft and Orbiter Operations**.
   - Modelled **Mono-nodal and multi-nodal thermal behavior of the Lander and Rover** using **MATLAB/Simulink** simulating the **worst case hot scenarios and worst case cold scenarios and various  Mars environmental conditions (day-night cycles, thermal fluxes)** to test subsystem performance.
   - Studied the **latest ECSS handbooks for the selction of materials for Thermal Control and for thermal control subsystem design (ECSS-E-HB-31-01)** and strictly adhered to the rules and designed the Thermal control subsystem. 
   - Worked with the **structures team head, AOCS Team head, TTMTC (Telemetry) team head and the Power subsystem team head** for obtaining inputs from all of their respective subsystems to have a precise and accurate modelling of the TCS subsystem.
   - Ensured **optimal limits for temperature regulation** of scientific instruments and electronic systems.
   - One of the main challenges that I faced during the modelling was the **calculation of the heat fluxes for the eMMRTG** (The technology that was decided to be the power source for the Rovers). 

4. **Key Results**:  
   - The **mass budget, power budget and the cost budget of each subsystem** was calculated for mission budgets breakdown.
   - **Heater sizing and radiator sizing** was calculated and designed based on the worst case scenarios to be within the optimal limits of the vehicles.
   - **Each instrument or component of the lander and rover** were modelled as a **separate node** in **MATLAB Simulink** and the multi nodal analysis was performed.
   - Technologies that were proposed as the final trade-offs were the use of **Silica Aerogel** as the insulator material for the vehicles due to their light weightedness as well as their **resistance to Martian dust storms** and **White Plaint - ZOT** was chosen as the outer paint coating for the vehicles.    
- Findings were selected for presentation at the **75th International Astronautical Congress (IAC 2024)** in Milan.
